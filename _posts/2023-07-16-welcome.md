I like science and art. You can peek into my thoughts through this site. 

These are some projects I have in mind:
Machine learning for chemistry
Raytracer
Simulations of soft matter
Quantum algorithms

My thesis is on fractional calculus. Some topics I believe to be important are 
statistical mechanics and thermodynamics and their applications in neural networks, swarm intelligence, and material science
non-classical computing paradigms such as membrane computing, chemical computing, quantum computing or DNA computing
continuum mechanics for biological and material modelling
topology and geometry for improving neural networks, modelling memory, physics, computer graphics and computer vision
general physics: classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, special and general relativity, and particle physics
